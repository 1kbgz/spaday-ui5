/** Tolerate another bundle having already registered elements this bundle also registers.
 *
 * This bundle registers every UI5 element at import. An application that ships its own copy
 * of UI5 rather than importing this one registers the same tag names, and whichever copy
 * loads second would throw from `customElements.define` and die entirely, taking the whole catalog
 * with it. Importing this module FIRST makes `define` idempotent (skip names that already exist);
 * `restoreDefine()` puts the real one back immediately after the upstream imports, so the guard
 * never leaks to other scripts.
 *
 * First registration wins, so this keeps the page alive; it does not make two copies agree. One
 * copy on the page is still the goal, which is what the package's import map is for.
